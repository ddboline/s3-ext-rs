S4 is attempt to provide a high-level API for S3. It is based on [Rusoto](https://www.rusoto.org/) and merely extents it's API.

* download object to a `Path` or `Write`
* upload object from `Path` or `Read`
* automatic multi-part upload based on object size with automatic clean-up on error
* simple way to iterate through all objects or objects with a given prefix

All functionality is provided by the `S4` trait which is implemented for *Rusoto*'s `S3Client`.
