//! Simpler Simple Storage Service: high-level API extensions for Rusoto's `S3Client`
//!
//! # TLS Support
//!
//! For TLS support [`rustls`](https://crates.io/crates/rustls) is used by default.
//!
//! Alternatively, [`native-tls`](https://crates.io/crates/native-tls) can be used by
//! disabling the default features and enabling the `native-tls` feature.
//!
//! For instance, like this:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! s4 = { version = "â€¦", default_features = false }
//!
//! [features]
//! default = ["s4/native-tls"]
//! ```
